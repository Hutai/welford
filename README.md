# welford - Online Variance with Welfords method

Computes the variance of a dataset by incrementally adding values to an accumulator. Welfords method is more numerically stable than the standard method.

Welfords method goes back to a 1962 paper by B. P. Welford and is presented in Donald Knuthâ€™s Art of Computer Programming, Vol 2.

This implemenation is modelled after the following:

* [Computing skewness and kurtosis in one pass](www.johndcook.com/blog/skewness_kurtosis)
